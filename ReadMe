I created a Java Spring Boot application for a ticket booking system that is able to handle high concurrency.
I used JDBC to connect Intellij with the MySQL workbench.
Built the code using controllers, DTOs, multiple repositories, services, and models to make sure the code follows all the good design practices and SOLID principles.
I used object-Relational mapping (JPA in my case) to handle the cardinality and to create objects
I used Lombok for getters and setters to make the code look cleaner.
Listed down the steps to handle concurrency in the Ticket Service class.
